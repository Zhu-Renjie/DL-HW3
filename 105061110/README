Follow these steps to excute the code:

Step 0.
Place the traing set and testing folder into this folder.

Step 1.
Execute data_prepro.py (need to uncomment the line 151~157).
It might take a while to process the whole training set and testing set.
The result will be store at prepor_train/ and prepro_test/ ,respectively.
For the result of data augmentation, they will be store in aug_train/. 

Dependency:
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn

2.
To produce the result of the assigment. Execute hw3_105061110.py.
Uncomment line 486 to produce Q3, same rule alppies. (Recommend do it one line at a time, otherwise GPU may fail)
The folder model/ is used to store the trained model. I extract parameters in the learned model to plot them out.

Dependency:
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow
